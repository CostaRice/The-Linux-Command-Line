I want to tell you a story.
我想告诉你们一个故事。

No, not the story of how, in 1991, Linus Torvalds wrote the first version of the Linux kernel.You can read 
that story in lots of Linux books. Nor am I going to tell you the story of how, some years earlier, Richard 
Stallman began the GNU Project to create a free Unix-like operating system. That’s an important story too,
but most other Linux books have that one, as well.
不，不是那个讲述林纳斯-托瓦兹在1991年如何写出了linux的第一个内黑版本。你们可以再很多linux的书里读到那个故事。
我也不会讲早些年理查德-斯托曼开始GNU项目来创造一个免费的类Unix操作系统。那也是一个重要的故事。但是大多数其他
Linux的书也会有那个故事。

No, I want to tell you the story of how you can take back control of your computer.
不，我想告诉你们如何夺回你的计算机控制权的故事。

When I began working with computers as a college student in the late 1970s, there was a revolution going on.
The invention of the microprocessor had made it possible for ordinary people like you and me to actually 
own a computer. It’s hard for many people today to imagine what the world was like when only big business
and big government ran all the computers. Let’s just say, you couldn’t get much done
当我在二十世纪七十年代晚期开始在大学里学习计算机的时，一场革命正在发生。微处理器的发明使像你和我这样的普通
人真的有可能拥有一台计算机。现在的很多人很难想象只有大公司和政府才有计算机的世界是什么样的。简单点儿说，你
做不了什么事情
